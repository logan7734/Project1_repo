Observations based on the data. While forwards are shooting 
  significantly more 3 pointers per year, they are shooting them at the same relative percentage.
I suspect centers are averaging more rebounds because of more shooting overall. 
More 3PS league wide will lead to more misses, which leads to more chances for rebounds.
